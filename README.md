# Wanderlust | Front-End

Link to app: https://Wanderlust-bw.herokuapp.com/

### What is Wanderlust?

Wanderlust brings tour guides and tourists together to streamline the process of finding specific tourist locations and experienced guides for tourists.

### What does Wanderlust do?

Wanderlust allows guides to create a collection of trips they offer. Descriptions, pictures, pricing, length, location, and language for a trip are created by guides. Guides can edit, add, and delete their own trips. Tourists can search by location and sign up for a guide's trips.

### Technologies Used

The front-end of Wanderlust was built using React, Redux, and Styled Components.

### Project Goal

The goal of this project was to deliver an MVP version of Wanderlust in 4 days.

### Project Stage

The project is functional at a basic level but requires additional features to be usable for the public. Interaction between tourists and guides needs implementation. Styling needs tweaks to match UX blueprint more closely.

### Known Issues

Minor style bugs at the moment.
